Thanks for download this model

If you find some edges error, turn on the "Auto Smooth" option (Look the instruction below) or apply the "Edge Split" Modifier if you use Blender

To turn on, go to:
1. Object Data Properties (Right Tabs)
2. Go to Normals and check the "Auto Smooth" option

If the texture is missing(Pink Color), then you need to locate it manually
